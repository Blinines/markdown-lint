tags:  [headers]
alias: first-header-h1

This rule is triggered when the first header in the document isn't a h1 header:

    ## This isn't a H1 header

    ### Another header

The first header in the document should be a h1 header:

    # Start with a H1 header

    ## Then use a H2 for subsections
