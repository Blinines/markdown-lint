# Markdown Lint Tool / Checker Documentation (Manuscripts Edition)

by Mark Harrison

> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the [official documentation](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint)
for the markdown lint style rules checker
reformatted in a single-page book edition.

See the [source repo](https://github.com/updownpress/updownpress.github.io) for how
the book gets auto-built with a static site builder and hosted on GitHub Pages.
